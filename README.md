# palette-viewer
### a small webpage to help you visualize a color palette.

With **palette-viewer** you can have a visual clue of how the colors in your palette work together.
It allows you to change the colors in real time. 

Whenever I'll have more time to spend on the project I'll make it so that you can add more (or less) then 6 colors, lable them and output them as sass, ready to use in your next project.
